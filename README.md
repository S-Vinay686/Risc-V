# Risc-VRISC-V Hands-On Learning Hub
This collection serves as a gateway to understanding RISC-V, covering both software and hardware perspectives from an intensive two-day session. It provides carefully curated resources to help participants grasp the essentials of RISC-V technology, its ecosystem, and practical implementations.

Program Overview:
Duration: 2 Days

Key Areas: RISC-V fundamentals, toolchain exploration, assembly programming, and efficiency optimization.

Day 1: Core Concepts
Introduction to RISC-V Architecture:
Examining the decentralized and customizable nature of RISC-V.

Understanding the Instruction Set Foundation (ISA), including its core functionalities and optional extensions.

Setting Up the Development Workflow:
Familiarization with RISC-V toolchains, including compilers, emulation software (e.g., Spike), and debugging frameworks.

Configuring a local or virtual environment to enable seamless RISC-V programming.

Practical Implementation:
Developing and executing introductory RISC-V programs within a simulated environment to gain hands-on proficiency.
